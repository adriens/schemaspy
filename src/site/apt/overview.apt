  Do you hate starting on a new project and having to try to figure out someone else's idea of a database? Or are you in 
  QA and the developers expect you to understand all the relationships in their schema? If so then this tool's for you.

  SchemaSpy is a Java-based tool (requires Java 5 or higher) that analyzes the metadata of a schema in a database and
generates a visual representation of it in a browser-displayable format. It lets you click through the hierarchy of
database tables via child and parent table relationships as represented by both HTML links and entity-relationship diagrams.
It's also designed to help resolve the obtuse errors that a database sometimes gives related to failures due to constraints.

  It is free software that is distributed under the terms of the {{{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html}Lesser GNU Public License 2.1}}.

  SchemaSpy uses the <dot> executable from {{{http://www.graphviz.org/}Graphviz}} to generate graphical representations of the
table/view relationships. This was initially added for people who see things visually. Now the graphical representation of relationships is a fundamental feature of the tool. Graphvis is not required to view the output generated by SchemaSpy, but the dot program should be in your PATH (not CLASSPATH) when running SchemaSpy or none of the entity relationship diagrams will be generated (or use the -gv option).

  SchemaSpy uses JDBC's database metadata extraction services to gather the majority of its information, but has to make vendor-specific SQL queries to gather some information such as the SQL associated with a view and the details of check constraints. The differences between vendors have been isolated to configuration files and are extremely limited. Almost all of the vendor-specific SQL is optional.

  Browse some sample pages generated by SchemaSpy. Note that this was run against an extremely limited schema so it doesn't show the full power of the tool.

  SchemaSpy is a command line tool. If you're more comfortable with the point-and-click approach then try out {{{http://www.joachim-uhl.de/}Joachim Uhl's}} {{{http://www.joachim-uhl.de/projekte/schemaspygui/}SchemaSpyGUI}}.
